Asimov is a gem that enables the use of OpenAI's ML capabilities within SaaS applications.  With that in mind it includes:

* The ability to use multiple OpenAI configurations (API keys and organization ids) within a single application.
* Support for configuring connections with timeouts and proxies to make applications robust against failure and to support complex network environments.
* Methods for all non-streaming endpoints in the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/).  (Streaming support is under consideration).


You can use this gem to write applications that generate text with GPT-3, create images with DALLÂ·E, or write code with Codex.

The name Asimov is a tribute to [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), a 20th century author whose work referenced AI extensively, most famously with his ["Three Laws of Robotics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). Asimov's stories explored the ethical and philosophical implications of using artificial intelligence and robots in society, and he is often credited with helping to popularize the concept of AI in science fiction. His work has had a lasting impact on the genre and has influenced many other writers and thinkers.
